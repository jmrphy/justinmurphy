I've been reflecting deeply on how AI is fundamentally changing everything in my workflow, particularly when it comes to blogging. Let me share a specific example that illustrates this transformation.

Until recently, I've been running my blog on Ghost Pro's platform. I chose it primarily for its clean, intuitive interface and simplicity. However, the rise of AI has completely shifted this paradigm. What once seemed "easy to use" now feels like unnecessary friction.

The pendulum has swung towards custom-coded solutions that live locally on my machine. Why? Because AI has eliminated the technical barriers that previously made custom development daunting. With AI assistance, I can:

- Build and modify my site with simple natural language commands
- Generate and publish content rapidly
- Maintain complete control over my workflow
- Eliminate unnecessary clicks and platform limitations

In fact, this very blog you're reading was created and deployed in about 10 minutes. It lives entirely on my computer, and I can create dozens of new posts daily if I choose to. The process is streamlined to the point where I can simply tell the AI what I want, and it goes live.

This shift represents a broader trend: AI is pushing us "closer to the metal" because it handles the technical complexity that previously drove us toward simplified, managed platforms. The hard stuff becomes easy, and the limitations of third-party platforms become more apparent.

While I have no grand ambitions for this particular site—it's purely a playground for experimentation—it represents an exciting shift in how we can approach content creation and web development.
