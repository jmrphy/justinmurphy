description: "Closer to the metal"

I don't intend to put very much on this site, but I threw up this blog structure anyway because it only took 10 minutes with AI coding.

I've been running Other Life on the Ghost Pro platform. I chose it primarily for its clean, intuitive interface and simplicity. But interestingly AI has now killed that rationale: It's actually easier to maintain a custom web app because the whole surface area can be managed with AI. "Easy" GUIs are now less efficient!

I can:

- Build and modify my site with simple natural language commands
- Generate and publish content rapidly
- Maintain complete control over the website and workflows
- Exceed any platform limitations

This blog lives on my Macbook and with one `git push` it goes live.

AI is pushing us closer to the metal because it handles the technical complexity that previously drove us toward simplified, managed platforms. What was hard becomes easy, and what was easy becomes harder.

That said, I have no grand ambitions for this particular site, I'm not sure if I'll even put anything on here!
